# As it's a very basic app, so the planning will be so simple too.

## 1. I can make every common components and save them on a folder called like "components" under the "src". Also I can make some different folder like "pages", "sections".

## 2. Using the components, I can make the static template. Also I can include style for them. 

## 3. As I don't have the ui for mobile. I must give some time to make the pages responsive.

## 4. After completing the UI, I can called the api's. I can use redux-toolkit for state management. 

## 5. If everything work successfully and console has no error or important warning. This app will be ready.
